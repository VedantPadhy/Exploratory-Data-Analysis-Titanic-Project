Objective: Extract insights using visual and statistical exploration
# Titanic EDA Project

## 📚 Project Description

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the famous Titanic dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights related to passenger survival rates based on different features such as gender, class, age, fare, and port of embarkation.

We use Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to perform statistical analysis and create meaningful visualizations.

## 📈 Key Steps Performed

- Loaded and inspected the Titanic dataset.
- Handled missing data in the `Age`, `Embarked`, and `Cabin` columns.
- Created a new feature `Has_Cabin` to capture missing cabin information.
- Univariate Analysis: Examined individual features like Survival, Sex, Age, Fare.
- Bivariate Analysis: Explored relationships between features and survival rates.
- Generated visualizations including count plots, histograms, box plots, and heatmaps.
- Summarized key findings about the survival factors.

## 📋 How to Run This Project

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `Task-5_Elevate_Labs_Internship.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Run each cell sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
4. To generate a new PDF, export the notebook as a PDF via the Export option.

## 🚀 Summary of Findings

- Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than males.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive than second- or third-class passengers.
- Younger passengers and children had better chances of survival.
- Higher fares and embarkation from Cherbourg (`C`) were associated with higher survival rates.
